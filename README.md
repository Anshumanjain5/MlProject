# 🎉 My First Machine Learning Project

Welcome to my first machine learning project! This repository contains the code, resources, and a machine learning model designed to **predict student performance** based on various features such as reading and writing scores, gender, and more.

## 🚀 Overview

The primary goals of this project are to:
- Learn the fundamentals of machine learning and its implementation.
- Experiment with popular ML frameworks, including **Scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**, and **CatBoost**.
- Build a predictive model that estimates student performance on math exams based on their other skills and background.

## 🔧 Installation

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anshumanjain5/MlProject
   cd MlProject
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) **Set up a virtual environment** to isolate your project dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Students Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977)
- **Description**: This dataset contains the results of several students based on various features such as:
  - **gender**: Male or Female
  - **race_ethnicity**: Caste/social group (A to E)
  - **parental_level_of_education**: Parent's education level
  - **lunch**: Whether the student has lunch before the exam
  - **test_preparation_course**: Whether the student took a test preparation course
  - **reading_score**: Student's reading skill score
  - **writing_score**: Student's writing skill score
  - **math_score**: Target variable – the student’s math score (to predict)

## 📈 Model

- **Algorithms Used**:
  - **Cross-validation** for model evaluation
  - **XGBoost** and **CatBoost** for gradient boosting-based prediction models
- **Frameworks**:
  - **Scikit-learn**: For basic preprocessing, splitting, and evaluation
  - **XGBoost** and **CatBoost**: For advanced ensemble modeling
- **Performance Metric**:
  - **R² Score**: Used to evaluate the model's predictive accuracy

## 📋 Features

Here’s a brief description of each feature used for prediction:

- **gender**: Gender of the student (Male/Female)
- **race_ethnicity**: The social group (A to E)
- **parental_level_of_education**: Highest education level achieved by the student's parents
- **lunch**: Whether the student has lunch before the test
- **test_preparation_course**: Whether the student attended a test preparation course
- **reading_score**: Reading test score
- **writing_score**: Writing test score
- **math_score**: The target variable – Math test score (to predict)

## 🛠️ Usage

To run the model training and evaluation, follow these steps:

1. **Run the main application script**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

This will load the dataset, preprocess the features, train the machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.

## 📝 Future Work

Here are some possible enhancements for the future:

- Hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance
- Support for additional datasets and more complex models
- Implementing a web interface to make predictions in real-time
